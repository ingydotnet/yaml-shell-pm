Installation
------------

You can install the latest release of YAML-Shell with this command:

  cpanm YAML::Shell

If you don't have `cpanm` yet, installation is simple. See:

  https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus#INSTALLATION

Or get the release information directly from:

  https://metacpan.org/release/YAML-Shell

Open Source
-----------

The code for YAML-Shell is hosted at GitHub. The URL is:

  https://github.com/ingydotnet/yaml-shell-pm

This project uses the Zilla-Dist framework for development and release
automation. You install it with:

  cpanm -n Zilla::Dist   # -n means "no test" which can save a lot of time

Once installed, run `zild make` to get a list of all the things you can do.
See https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Zilla-Dist/lib/Zilla/Dist.pod for
more information.

NOTE: If you just want to run the tests without installing Zilla::Dist, use:

  prove -lv test/
